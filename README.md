Handwritten digit recognition implemented by TensorFlow and Flask.

## Why?

Just for learning by doing. After learning Flask and TensorFlow, I think I suppose to build something interesting in order to combine with Flask and TensorFlow. 

In this project, I use TensorFlow to train the model and use Flask as the server, for front-end, I make a canvas to draw digit, It's easy to understand and learn. 


## How to run?

```
$ git clone https://github.com/InnoFang/what-digit-you-write.git
$ cd what-digit-you-write
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python app.py
```
